Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

This app was created as a way to track a user's weight.  Some of the requirements included: a database with at least 3 tables, a screen to log in, a place to create an account, a screen with a grid to display daily weights entered, and a notification system.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The login screen, create account screen, and the main weight screen were all necessary screens.  There also needed to be a place to enter weights, both daily and a goal weight.  While I was creating the design I kept it as simple as possible while incorporating all the necessary components.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

I create code modularly, meaning I would create one section at a time and make sure it worked before moving on to the next step.  That is one of the best ways to ensure that any bugs are caught as early as possible.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

I would run the code through the debugger after each section was created to ensure it was functioning as intended.  This is important to make sure there are no problems that are easily fixable.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

While creating this app I ran into many problems.  In order to create a full app, you must be creative and think outside the box to create something that hasn't been created.  There were many times while working I though what can I do to make my app different from all those out there.

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I believe I was successful in creating an app that is functional, aside from the permissions not working.  That in itself is one of the biggest challenges to overcome.  I have created successful applications prior to this, but not as much of the UI as I created in this app.  I do believe that was one of my favorite things to create though.
